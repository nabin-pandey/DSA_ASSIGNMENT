# DSA Assignment_2

This repository contains all programs and documents for the Data Structures and Algorithms assignment. 
It demonstrates the implementation of various data structures such as stacks, queues, linked lists, and other data structure with their applications. 
The code is written in C and organized into source files, with accompanying notes and documenatation.
